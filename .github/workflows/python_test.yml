# GitHub-specific continuous integration (CI) configuration, enabling the usual
# GitHub Actions workflow for pure-Python packages exercised by "tox".

#FIXME: [CACHING] Add support for caching "pip" downloads across runs.
#Currently, unresolved issues in GitHub Actions prevents sane caching of "pip"
#downloads. Naturally, horrifying hacks circumventing these issues do exist but
#are presumably worse than these issues. See also this pertinent comment:
#    https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/342#issuecomment-673371329
#FIXME: [CACHING] Huzzah! The "setup-python" action itself now supports
#out-of-the-box caching. Note that doing so will require a minor of
#configuration on our part -- but nothing *TOO* tremendous, hopefully. See:
#    https://github.com/actions/setup-python#caching-packages-dependencies

        # List of all "tox" environments (defined by the "envlist" setting of
        # the "[tox]" subsection in "tox.ini") to be tested, which the
        # ${TOXENV} environment variable declared below exposes to "tox".
        tox-env:
          - py311-coverage
          - py312-coverage

        # Map each "tox" environment name listed in the "tox-env" list above to
        # the corresponding "python-version" string supported by the
        # "actions/setup-python" GitHub Action run below.
        #
        # Note that:
        # * Python version specifiers *MUST* be quoted: e.g.,
        #     # Do this.
        #     python-version: "3.10"
        #     # Do *NOT* do this.
        #     python-version: 3.10
        #   Why? Because YAML sensibly treats an unquoted literal satisfying
        #   floating-point syntax as a floating-point number and thus silently
        #   truncates *ALL* ignorable zeroes suffixing that number (e.g.,
        #   truncating 3.10 to 3.1). That then results in non-human-readable CI
        #   errors, as discussed upstream at:
        #     https://github.com/actions/setup-python/issues/160#issuecomment-724485470
        # * Python pre-releases may be selected with a space-delimited range
        #   embedded in a single quoted version specifier. For example,
        #   selecting the Python 3.11 pre-release reduces to:
        #     python-version: "3.11.0-alpha - 3.11.0"
